Array cannot grow dynmaically but linked list can grow dynamically.. Array is continous location and bracuase of this we can access randomly access any element . 
but in linked list we cannot access any randomly list and it is access sequential... 

Need of linked list:- 

Array - get/set o(1)
linked list:- non continous allocation...
