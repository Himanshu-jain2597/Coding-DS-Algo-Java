  
Size of array is fixed 


This diadvantage is solved by arraylist. 

Arraylist is dynamic in nature. if don't have to specify an size initally. it will grow on its own.


ArrayList<Integer> arr = new ArrayList<Integer>;  // initalizing of arraylist


default capacity of arrayList -2
default size of arrayList -0 // no element is added

arr.size()  // total element in arrayList. 

arr.add(1) // to add an element in arrayList. 


arr.get(1)  // to get first element from arrayList.

arr.remove(3) // to remove an element at index 3 and move all the element greater then 3 a position ahead.
