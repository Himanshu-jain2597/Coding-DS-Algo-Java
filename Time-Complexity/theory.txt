criteria on which time complexity dependes:-
1. Input size( for very large input which algorithim face less time.)


Big O :- it denotes worst case o(1) means constant time..

worst case:- 
linear search :-  o(n)
binarysearch:- o(logn)
mergesort:- o(nlogn)
quick sort:- o(nlogn)
bubble sort:- o(n^2)
selection sort:- o(n^2)
finnonci := o(2^n)
sieve of enthosis :- o(nloglogn)

stack:-
insertion in stack:- O(1)
deletion in stack:- o(1)


queue:- 
insertion in queue:- o(1)
deletion in queue:- o(1)



To Find Time Complexity in Recursion:- 
No. of function calls * work done in 1st frame.
calls^ht * work done
